# Arduino

Arduino is an open-source hardware and software company, project and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices.(ref: Wikipedia)

We suggest you to use tinkercad (an online software for stimulations of arduino) and learn by doing things,before just begining to start writing code make sure you understand the concept and the design of arduino
go through an introductory course from udemy before starting 
you must be able to answer these basic questions
1.total no of pins
2.use of different pins how to interconnect them
3.why doesnt it blow if i provide voltage greater than 5v
4.use of capacitors on arduino
5.difference between microcontroller and microprocessor


after you are familiar with the basic concepts of arduino, start making your own project,use additional devices its sensors to make cool stuff 
few examples of projects which you can try 

1.motion detector for hand washing(if u bring ur hands close to tap it starts else stops)
2.line follower bot
3.3D matrix made of leds with different lighting techniques

make sure to do a project by your own as you will encounter many difficultis and learn on the way.
