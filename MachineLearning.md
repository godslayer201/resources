# Machine learning with Python resources

## Resources for Learning ML

- [Googleâ€™s Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/): This is a free class provided by the developers at Google. It includes written materials, lecture videos, and lots of code exercises to practice Python coding. The first exercises work on basic Python concepts like strings and lists, building up to the later exercises which are full programs dealing with text files, processes, and Http connections.

- [Introduction to Data Science using Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-data-science-using-python/): In this course, you will understand the basics of data science and analytics as well as how to use Python and scikit-learn. The course will show you what data science is and how is it used. You will go through commonly used terms and write some code in Python as well.   
- [Data Science, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Python & R](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-machine-learning-data-analysis-python-r/): This course has been designed by data scientists to help you learn complex theory, algorithms, and Python libraries. With every tutorial, you will develop new skills and improve your understanding of this challenging yet lucrative sub-field of data science. The course includes both Python and R and is also packed with practical exercises that are based on real-life examples.

- [MatPlotLib with Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/matplotlib-with-python/): This course has been designed for those who want to learn a variety of ways to visually display data. 

- [Machine Learning With Python](https://pythonizame.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Book/machine-learning-python-essential-techniques-predictive-analysis/file/008c0aac-9784-11e5-964d-04015fb6ba01.pdf): In this e-book, you will learn essential techniques of machine learning in predictive analysis using Python programming language.

PREREQUISITES FOR ML
1.statistics knowledge
2.Matrix
3.probability 
if you dont know any of these topics i say go and take the course of maths for ml from coursera {https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning}

after you are clear with the prerequisites then i say learn python 
for learning python you can go through any youtube course

(dont spend more than a week in learning prerequisites and python)
it is very simple and requires only few hours
after learning python take a course i would say to take ml 2020 course on udemy first before taking andrew ngs ML course on coursera as you will get the basics cleared first.

After that you will have sufficient knowledge about ML and can start working on your own project

PS. dont forget to make notes in your class as you will be refering it again.
Thankyou.
hope this topic helped you.
